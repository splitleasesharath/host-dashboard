BACKUP CREATED: December 19, 2024

This backup contains the working version of the Host House Manual dashboard with:

1. Fixed guest cards that match manual card styling exactly
2. Horizontal meta items with icons
3. Proper button styling
4. Working sidebar navigation
5. Consistent section layouts

Key files backed up:
- dashboard.html (main dashboard with fixed guest section)
- dashboard-styles.css (all styles including fixed guest card CSS)
- dashboard-script.js (JavaScript with working navigation)
- host-styles.css (base styles)

The guest cards now use the manual card classes for perfect consistency:
- manuals-section (container)
- manual-card (each card)
- manual-icon, manual-content, manual-meta, manual-actions (card structure)
- manual-btn (buttons)

This ensures the guest cards look exactly like manual cards with proper horizontal layout.
